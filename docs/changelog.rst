Changelog
=========

1.5.0  - New Features:

       - Included option (--config-file) to define a .yaml file with all options but input and output filenames.
         if this option is used all other options are ignored. any options not present in this file will be set to default

       - Included option (--report-type) to define the type of report and created two new types of reports:
         - a report summarizing the hosts with the highest number of vulnerabilities and sum of all its cvss severities and including a tab for each host listing each vulnerability
         - a csv report ordered by host with all vulnerabilities (same fields as the by vulnerability type)
           (I don't believe it's worth creating a .docx version of this report, so I'm not creating it)

       - Included option (--network-exclude) to define a file with a list of ips or ipcidrs or range of ips (one by line) that will be excluded from the report

       - Included option (--network-include) to define a file with a list of ips or ipcidrs or range of ips (one by line) that will be included in the report

       - Included option (--regex-include) to define a file with a list of regex expressions to include in the report
         the regex expressions will be matched against the name of the vulnerability

       - Included option (--regex-exclude) to define a file with a list of regex expressions to exclude in the report
         the regex expressions will be matched against the name of the vulnerability

       - Included option (--cve-include) to define a file with a list of CVE numbers to include in the report
